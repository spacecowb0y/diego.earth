Every time I try a new technology, especially one that it purposes it’s to make it easier to publish something on the Internet I feel the urgency to try it. That’s exactly what happened when I found [Gatsby.js](https://gatsbyjs.org/) while browsing on [Github’s Explore](https://github.com/explore) front page a few months ago.

Soon I’ll publish a new entry about how I build this blog, stay tuned!
