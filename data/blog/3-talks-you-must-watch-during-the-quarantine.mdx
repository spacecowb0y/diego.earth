I think it's a good time to listen to those who think clearly about the present moment. I picked: Slavoj Zizek, Yuval Noah Harari and Noam Chomsky.

### 1. Slavoj Zizek on Coronavirus: "Things will not go back to normal."

In his recent chat with Renata √Åvila for DiEM25 TV, Zizek discussed the Coronavirus pandemic, the ways in which governments are responding to the crisis, why it proves Bernie Sanders right and why this might be the opportunity for a new kind of politics.

### 2. Yuval Noah Harari on COVID-19's Impact on Humankind

James Corden connects with historian, philosopher and author Yuval Noah Harari for a video chat and the two talk about the potential society-shifting impact of COVID-19 on an international, national and institutional level. And Yuval describes why humankind must be vigilant of how technology could ultimately strip everyone of any form of privacy.
