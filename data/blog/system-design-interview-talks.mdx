During the call I used [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) an online tool for drawings. The interviewers were seeking to understand my technical decisions and justifications for them. Also, how I communicate, collaborate together to reach a solution, and how pragmatic I was with my approach.

### How did I prepare for this? Where should I start?

Well, my first approach was to look up for youtube videos of people talking about this topic and this is what I found.

After watching this I felt way much more confident about the goal of the session, and I lerned on which direction should I focus the conversation. Hopefully it helps you as well.
