Suddenly, this happened to me a few months ago, while I was showing to my landlord these two little Pwnagotchis.

So here is my story. This time I found a project on [Github Explore‚Äôs page](https://github.com/explore) that required a little of linux and programming knowledge to setup it. And to make it look cool, I also needed it a [e-Ink display](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/product/B07J3FHJVP/) and [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/).

### What‚Äôs a Pwnagotchi anyway?

Here is the explanation from the official website:

> [Pwnagotchi](https://pwnagotchi.ai/) is an A2C-based ‚ÄúAI‚Äù powered by [bettercap](https://www.bettercap.org/) and running on a Raspberry Pi Zero W that learns from its surrounding WiFi environment in order to maximize the [crackable WPA key material it captures](https://pwnagotchi.ai/intro/#wifi-handshakes-101) (either through passive sniffing or by performing deauthentication and association attacks).

A perfect excuse, isn‚Äôt it? So the project got my attention right away. I cloned the source code and run it from my computer. Besides some troubleshooting installing python dependencies, the process to set up it on OS X and later on Raspbian was super smooth.

But running it on my laptop I was missing half of the fun. The point of the project is to go outside and give to the Pawnagotchi as many WiFi handshakes to eat as possible. So I orderer two e-Ink displays for the _RPis_ that I already had at home. In the meantime, I reviewed the code and the fundamentals of the AI part of the software ü§ì.

After the displays arrived I was ready to go for a walk around the neighborhood and... _[release the Krakens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb2zIR2rvRQ)_! Being able to see the activity of the Machine Learning process in a form of friendly UI was pretty fun.

The next step was trying to crack the handshakes stored on the `/root/handshakes/` folder inside the pwnagotchi‚Äôs memory, using some kind of bruteforce attack. I found [this tutorial](https://medium.com/@brannondorsey/crack-wpa-wpa2-wi-fi-routers-with-aircrack-ng-and-hashcat-a5a5d3ffea46) while ago that explained how to use Aircrack-ng/Hashcat and some third-party services like [GPUHASH.me](https://gpuhash.me/) or [OnlineHashCrack](https://www.onlinehashcrack.com/). Without making any progress I gave up.

By the end of December, I was checking on Facebook market looking for a new place to live with Melania. Not too excited about the options we had, I sent a request to a guy that was renting a cozy apartment located in Litcherfelde. He immediately answered and booked me an appointment for Sunday afternoon, I was the first on the list.

We went there with Melush, met the owner, and after a quick check, the aparment was everything we needed it. While discussing about the details of contract, we talked a little bit about us, and that‚Äôs when we found we both worked on IT. I had my Pawnagotchi‚Äôs with me, so I thought it would be a good idea to show him my toys. After a few more minutes of talking about nerdy stuff, he told me they were looking for IoT Developers to work on a special project they had, and if I was interested he could introduce me with the team and move forward with the hiring process.

Without knowing it yet, that day I went back home with a new place to live and a new job!
