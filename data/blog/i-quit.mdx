My latest accomplishment was being able to use 15% less of my phone, even being locked at home because of the coronavirus situation. The purpose of doing it is to keep away everything that distracts me or provokes me anxiety.

So today, I quit social media. Yes, that's right:

- Goodbye Facebook _(11 years old account, &#8734; content)_ ðŸ‘‹
- Chau Instagram _(7 years old account, 2k pictures)_ ðŸ‘‹
- TschÃ¼ss Twitter _(12 years old account, 50k tweets)_ ðŸ‘‹

Let see what happens. If you want to reach me, you can find me on [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/@d:matrix.0xff.cafe) ðŸ™ƒ
