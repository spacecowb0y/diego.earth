## Things I’ve done

I planned to start my healing process and recover from the recent breakup, I wanted to feel as better as possible before moving to a new country and being far away from everyone that supports me.

### Timeline

📦 **January**:
I signed the contract for my new apartment, it was time to move from the place that was our home for the last 3 years.

🏖 **February**:
I decided to slowly stop working and take and a break until next year.

🥰 **March**:
I started a new friendship with someone I found spending time with is somehow different than with everyone else. When we are together every moment looks like it was recorded on 35mm Fuji film, does it make sense? It does for me.

😻 **April**:
Emilio and I made a trip to Ramos Mejia to rescue baby Melania Teodora from the evil hands of capitalism (?). She became part of the crew immediately.

🏔 **May**:
[I traveled to Bariloche](https://photos.diego.earth/r/16255682927936) to take a break from the city and gain some perspective. Buenos Aires life rhythm can be insanely energy-draining some times.

🏡 **June**:
I made a trip to my hometown, I wanted to say goodbye to my family and friends. Then, an unexpected adventure happened. My friend Marco took me on his truck to a 24hs road-trip to Mar del Plata.

🇩🇪 **July**:
Finally! My suitcase and my backpack were ready. Melania was on her cage and our Uber to Ezeiza was waiting downstairs. Berlin, here we go!

👫 **August**:
My partner moved to Berlin as well. This was a happy coincidence, moving to Germany was a plan we both had before start our relationship.

🧭 **September**:
We spent time exploring Berlin. Also, we found a German school in our neighborhood so we started a German intensive course. Sadly, we didn't learn as much as we expected on the first course but we made some good friends in the process.

🛂 **October**:
[I went to Berna, Switzerland](https://photos.diego.earth/r/16255680488236) to apply for my visa. And I got it in just 4 days!

🚍 **November**:
We bought two bus tickets and visited Nuremberg first and then Rothenburg ob der Tauber. Germany's countryside is beautiful, and Rothenburg is a magical town.

🎄 **December**:
We spent the last month of the year [traveling to London](https://photos.diego.earth/r/16255681122862), assisted to our friend's wedding and ended up spending our first Christmas
together there!

That's pretty much it. It was a very intense year, full of changes. I'm looking forward to 2020 and wishing you all the best!
