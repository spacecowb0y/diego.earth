If you’re looking for ideas about how to build a better company, you can’t go wrong with these two:

- [It Doesn’t Have to Be Crazy at Work](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38900866-it-doesn-t-have-to-be-crazy-at-work), by Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson.
- [Reinventing Organizations: A Guide to Creating Organizations Inspired by the Next Stage of Human Consciousness](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20787425-reinventing-organizations), by Frederic Laloux and Ken Wilber.

Do you want to learn how to sell great products and how to create a great marketing strategy? The folks at Intercom are doing a great job on that and they recently released a series of books, I highly recommend you to start with one of these:

- [Intercom on Marketing](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37908858-intercom-on-marketing), by Des Traynor and Matt Hodges.
- [Intercom on Jobs-to-be-Done](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30314875-intercom-on-jobs-to-be-done), by Des Traynor.

For the last 4 years I’ve been dealing with some situations that lead me to extreme anxiety. Cannabis used to help me on this until it didn’t. Thankfully I found this book which I’ll never get tired to recommend:

- [The Wisdom of Insecurity: A Message for an Age of Anxiety](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/551520.The_Wisdom_of_Insecurity), by Alan W. Watts.

Ever wondered how the hell the human species got to the point of where we are now? This book is a walk-through of 100,000 years of history:

- [Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23692271-sapiens), by Yuval Noah Harari.

Last but not least, bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is a topic which fascinates me. I’ve listened to all Andreas talks and Q&As (I mentioned one on [a previous post](https://blog.diego.earth/on-bitcoin-and-cryptocurrencies)) so I decided to read his books:

- [The Internet of Money](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31869077-the-internet-of-money), by Andreas M. Antonopoulos.
- [Mastering Bitcoin: Unlocking Digital Cryptocurrencies](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21820378-mastering-bitcoin), by Andreas M. Antonopoulos.

That’s it! There is a huge list of books I’d love to read next year, you can [follow me on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46795449-diego-peralta) if you are curious about what’s on it.
