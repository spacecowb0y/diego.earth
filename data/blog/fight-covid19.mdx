### What is Fold for Covid, and how does it help?

> [The Fold for Covid project](https://foldforcovid.io/) aims to make it easy to donate spare compute capacity to support COVID-19 research with a few simple steps. This effort contributes to the [Rosetta@Home](https://boinc.bakerlab.org/) project, led by the [Baker Laboratory at the University of Washington](https://www.bakerlab.org/), which uses distributed computing to help scientists and doctors find potential treatments for COVID-19.
>
> Your contributions help researchers look for proteins that bind to the famous ‚Äúspike‚Äù protein on COVID-19. By finding these binding proteins, doctors hope to develop medicines that prevent the virus from entering healthy cells.

A few weeks ago, I was setting the dev environment in one of the many Raspberry Pis we have in our IoT lab at [Rent24](//rent24.com), and one of the ads displayed on the Balena Etcher app cought my attention. I clicked on it and stumbled upon with The Fold for Covid homepage. I've hear about [Rosetta@Home](https://boinc.bakerlab.org/rosetta/) and [SETI@home](https://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/) before, but I was surprised they were already using the same technology to fight Coronavirus. I followed the process suggested on their website:

1. Downloaded the [Fold for Covid](https://foldforcovid.io/) project software.
2. Downloaded and installed [balenaEtcher](https://balena.io/etcher).
3. Launched balenaEtcher and flashed a few SD cards.
4. Booted the bunch of Raspberry Pis, and connected them to our network, boom! üí•
