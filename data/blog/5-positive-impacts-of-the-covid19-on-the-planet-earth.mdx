Governments from all countries, public and private institutions and companies from all industries are acting as fast as possible to mitigate the damages of this unprecedented event. I know is to early to get into a conclusion but here is a list of five things that I think they have changed for the better in our World:

### 1. Free access to online educational material

In the US, schools and universities have opened access to their whole bibliography and research resources. I‚Äôm not sure if you know this but, [Aaron Swartz](http://www.aaronsw.com/), an internet activist, was prosecuted after downloading many academic articles through the MIT computer network from a source for which he had an account as a Harvard research fellow. Because of the possibility of imprisonment, Aaron committed suicide 7 years ago üò¢.

At the same time, teachers have organized themself to provide their students with access to homework and educational material using social networks and online tools like [Dropbox](//dropbox.com) or [Google Docs](//google.com/docs). I wish that this experience is going to provide us with great insights that could help to shape the future of education.

### 2. Thousands of companies embraced remote working

Most governments have locked down their cities to stop the spread of the virus, and because of this a lot of companies have been forced to let their employees work from home to keep their operations ongoing. While some companies like Facebook decided to give money to their employees to set up an office on their houses, others decided to spent it on software to monitor their online activities ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

If you are looking for advice on how to work remotely, Gitlab‚Äôs folks share great tips based on their experience:

### 3. CO2 emission reduction all around the world

I think this video speaks for itself, see what happened on Italy after a month of being locked down:

Or check [this article from the BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-51944780) that talks about the situation in China and the rest of the world.

### 4. Massive digitalization of businesses

Another consequence of forcing everyone to stay at home is the acceleration digitalization of businesses. I think this is great to not paralyze the economy 100% by closing every shop or market.

Stripe provides a great list of online resources to lunch your business online. You can check it here: [COVID-19 resources for Stripe users

So if you are a Web Developer, UI Designer or Online Marketer give it a hand to that friend who owns a small retail shop to build their website, it‚Äôs about time!

### 5. Real Estate agencies from Argentina started to accept bank transfers üéâ

Well, it‚Äôs 2020 and 99.99% of the Real Estate agencies in Argentina don‚Äôt accept bank transfers or any kind of electronic payment. So every month you have to go to the agency to pay your rent if you are a tenant, crazy isn‚Äôt it? Now, they have been forced to accept more payment solutions or they cannot get paid. Seriously, a worldwide crisis was needed for this to change?

Without being an expert, it smells like this situation is far from over. I hope that you, your family, and your friends are safe and healthy ‚úåüèª.
