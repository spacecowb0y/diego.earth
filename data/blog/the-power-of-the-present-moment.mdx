title: 'To truly experience life, have awareness in the present moment'
summary: 'Has this ever happened to you: You’re feeling particularly unhappy or hopeless, and someone, instead of taking pity, tells you that you’re thinking too much? It might seem a bit callous, but, actually, that person was probably right.'

Many people are disappointed with life not because of what they’re doing but because they’re fixated on what they need to do or what they regret not having done.

So, instead of planning out the future or bemoaning the past, why we don't focus on the experiences of the present?.

Simply put, thinking about something is never as profound as actually feeling it. Take music, for example. Thinking about a Mozart symphony is nothing compared to being in the audience and letting the music wash over you.

The same can be said for any experience. Don’t think about how it will impact you later. Enjoy it now.

You might be wondering: What if the present moment is making me miserable? Shouldn’t I be focusing on pleasant prospects or comforting memories?

Actually, **resisting or denying present emotions** will only make matters worse.

> Life is like a long and powerful river. From time to time, there will be some rapids. All you can do is ride it out. Resist or try to get back upstream, and you might drown. Stay calm and ride the waves, and the river will carry you to a safer place.

Furthermore, this is exactly how your mind works. It <em>wants</em> to give in to the emotions you are experiencing. It’s only when you try to resist or escape these painful emotions that anxiety takes hold. If you embrace frightening emotions and experiences, the tensions will subside.

Understand that there is no such thing as true security in life. So, rather than falling into a state of anxiety, accept insecurity and pain as a part of life by being aware in the present moment. This will help you find **tranquility and contentment**.

All of these ideas are borrowed from Alan's book: [The Wisdom of Insecurity](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/551520.The_Wisdom_of_Insecurity). And I'll never get tired of recommending it.
