title: 'Fraidycat: follow from afar'
summary: "Did I mention I quit social media? I think I did. And it felt great, the negative side it's I miss reading the stupid and not so stupid things my friends are posting."

As I'm getting older, I don't enjoy writing code just for the sake of coding anymore 🤷🏻‍♂️, I'm a little tired of reinventing the wheel over and over, I've been doing it since I'm 16 years old. So before jumping into my coding editor of choice (VS Code), I went to Github and searched for: `social media scrappers`. BINGO!

### What's Fraidycat anyways?

> [Fraidycat](https://fraidyc.at/) is a desktop app or browser extension for Firefox or Chrome. I use it to follow people (hundreds) on whatever platform they choose - Twitter, a blog, YouTube, even on a public TiddlyWiki.

I watched the sick intro video the [author's](https://www.kickscondor.com/) made and got sold!

If you want to dig more on Fraidycat's, check the [README.md](https://github.com/kickscondor/fraidycat/blob/master/README.md).

So they only job left was to migrate my list of contacts and subscribe to my favorite RSS feeds. Profit! 💰

Thanks [kickscondor](https://www.kickscondor.com/) for this terrific job!
