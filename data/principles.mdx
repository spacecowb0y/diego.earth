### üå± For life

1. [Be a prism, not a mirror](https://multiverse.plus/wuz/are-you-a-mirror). Seek to digest and break apart information, not just pass it on to someone else.
2. Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others. ([Robustness principle](https://medium.com/@shaunak/the-robustness-principle-affa8219e9af))
3. Observe. Accept. Release. Transform.
4. Sharing is growing and caring.
5. Learning by doing. Teaching by example.

### üë®üèª‚Äçüíª For programming

1. Know your tools and build your own for repeated workflows.
2. Done is better than perfect.
3. Develop. Preview. Ship. **Repeat**.
4. Premature optimization is the root of all evil.
5. Read the Fucking Manual (RTFM).
6. Documentation Driven Development (DDD).
7. Open Source All The Things!
8. Some programmers are 10x more efficient than others. I know because I've been both a 10x programmer and a -1x programmer.
9. You may think that software development at a software company serves the customer directly, but you‚Äôd be mistaken. **The organisation is the software development team‚Äôs primary customer**.
10. The Web is **my empathy medium**.

### üöÄ For building products

1. First, do not harm.
2. Build. Measure. Learn.
3. Experiments instead of Products.
4. Fight the <s>good</s> **right** fight.

### üë• For building organizations

1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
2. Culture is what you document.
3. Develop a culture where hard conversations are actively encouraged. **Care deeply, but challenge directly**.
4. **Collaboration requires leading by example.** And by example I don't mean being someone with lots of ideas. I mean someone who actually enacts on their ideas and tries to get stuff done.
