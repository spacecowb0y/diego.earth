I was born in a beautiful day on the summer of January 1990 in Bahia Blanca, Argentina 🇦🇷. I'm the human of the cute cat you can see in the picture above. Her name is Melania Teodora. And we're both living in Berlin 🇩🇪.

I’ve dreamed about building things on the Internet since the first time I heard the old dial-up modem sound next to my computer, back in 1998. Later on, while still being in high school I learned enough web programming languages like HTML, CSS, and PHP to start developing websites for local businesses.

Early in my career, I worked for companies that were offering remote job opportunities on different outsourcing platforms, mostly from North America and Europe. In those years, I coded a wide range of applications and websites. During that period I also learned how to lead teams to deliver kick-ass and award-winning products.

In September 2010 I founded Pixel2HTML a remote-first web development company. Since then our team helped hundred of design agencies, tech startups, and businesses listed on the Fortune 500 to bring their ideas to the digital world.

After running my own business for 9 years, I decided to take a break on my entrepreneurial adventures and moved from Argentina to Germany to focus on helping other companies to build their software needs.
