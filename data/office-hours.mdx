### What I’m offering

I’m setting aside time during the week if you want someone to bounce ideas off of. We can talk about any topic you like, but here’s some subjects I think I might specifically be able to help you out with:

- Modern frontend architecture and tooling, specially using libreries like Svelte, React or Next.js
- Web performance and accessibility
- Offline first applications
- Distrubuted databases like CouchDB
- Decentralized apps and Web3

Worse comes to worse, I’m an excellent [rubber duck](https://rubberduckdebugging.com/).

### What I’m not offering

Just to make sure our expectations are aligned: I will not do your work for you, but I will happily help you work through it and point you to relevant resources!

I will hang up on you if you try to sell me something.

### Who I’d like to hear from

Anyone of any skill level! This kind of things can seem intimidating, but I'd like to help if I can. If it turns out you know more than me, I’d love the opportunity to learn from you.

### How to set up a meeting

[Pick up a date and time](https://calendly.com/diego-peralta/office-hours) on my calendar and we can schedule a call. I like [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/), but I'm happy to use another service if it is more convenient for you.

For scheduling purposes, I work from [Central European Time](https://time.is/berlin) (CET), typically from 9 to 6. Meetings will last about 30 minutes.

I’m looking forward to meet you! ✨
